This is a project that I did on a master set for a business entity dashboard.

Master set( This dataset represents the workforce of a multinational business organization, comprising employees from various countries across the globe. It provides comprehensive information on the availability of staff members. By utilizing the drill-through feature in Power BI, viewers can delve into specific details regarding the staff members. This feature allows users to explore additional information and gain deeper insights by navigating through the dataset.

The dashboard presents a summary of the workforce, highlighting key statistics. It shows that there are 16 departments within the organization, encompassing a total of 308 employees from 7 different countries.)

This was part of a personal project and it was built to track the sales of specific items.

Sales table(This sales table aims to analyze revenue, profit, and sales quantity using various models and trends. It provides insights into the contribution of different markets in terms of revenue, profit contribution, and overall profit. By applying various filters, the data is visualized and distributed to highlight the distribution of these metrics. The use of percentage contributions facilitates a clear understanding of the visuals, enabling viewers to grasp the relative significance of each market's contribution.
